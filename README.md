# Etamax
The ETAMAX Website offers a wide array of functions and facilities for the students
who wish to participate in the various events held during the cultural festival hosted by Fr C.
Rodrigues Institute of Technology,Vashi.. Every year during the annual cultural festival of the
college Fr C Rodrigues Institute of Technology, Vashi, the students from the host college as well
as students from other colleges find it difficult to obtain the information regarding the events that
would be held in the course of three days during the fest. Students often had to download an
application in order to register for the events. This process was too long and also, this application
didnâ€™t contain any field regarding the information of the college and the events

This issue can be solved by developing a dedicated website solely for this purpose.
Through this website, we intend to develop a website where students can get information about
the various events like the schedule for events, registration fees of each events, eligibility etc.
The students participating would get a confirmation message after successfully registering for the
said events. The website would also contain a contact page where students and other people can
contact the organizers for sponsorship purpose or feedback message
